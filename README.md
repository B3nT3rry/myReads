# React Nanodegree MyReads
---



## Introduction 

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my understanding of the basic structure and
operation of a React app for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program.



## How to install the app



The project has used the Create-React-App starter app and also uses Node.js.  If you do not have Node it can
be downloaded from here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)



Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app and 
git clone
https://github.com/B3nT3rry/MyReads.git then 

run 
npm install


Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with


npm start



A new browser window should automatically open, displaying the app if this doesn't happen you will need to
navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser



## Using the MyReads app



# Books are sorted into three categories: 
	
	- Currently Reading
	
	- Want to Read
	
	- Read


# To move the book to a different shelf click on the green button to open a pop out where you can choose from 
the following categories
	
	- None
	
	- Currently Reading
	
	- Want to Read
	
	- Read  


# To add any new books you will need to click on the green + button at the bottom of the page. This will open
up the Search bar where you can enter an author's name or subject. Up to 20 items will be returned.
